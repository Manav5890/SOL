SQL> -- OPERARTOR -In SQL, an operator is a symbol or keyword used to perform operations on data.
SQL> 
SQL> -- Q256 The BETWEEN operator in SQL is used to filter results within a specified inclusive range of values, making it ideal for conditions like date ranges or numerical limits (e.g., salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000). In contrast, the IN operator allows you to filter results based on a discrete set of specific values, making it useful for matching against multiple options (e.g., department_id IN (10, 20, 30)).
